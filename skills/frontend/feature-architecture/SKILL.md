description: "Feature folder structure and architecture for React + TypeScript admin apps. Use this when creating a new feature, adding a major section, or when asked how to organize a feature's files. Covers the canonical folder layout (components, hooks, services, types, schemas, constants, utils), what goes where, index export conventions, and how features connect to routes."

```

## What Goes Where

### `types/index.ts`
All TypeScript types for the feature — API response shapes, filter params, form data types.

```ts
export interface YourFeature {
  id: number
  name: string | null
  // ...
}

export interface YourFeaturesResponse {
  items: YourFeature[]
  total: number
}

export interface YourFeatureFilterParams {
  page?: number
  page_size?: number
  search?: string
  // ...
}
```

### `constants/your-feature.constants.ts`
Three things: API endpoint strings, TanStack Query key factory, and option arrays.

```ts
export const YOUR_FEATURE_ENDPOINTS = {
  BASE: '/v1/admin/your-features',
  DETAIL: (id: number) => `/v1/admin/your-features/${id}`,
  UPDATE: (id: number) => `/v1/admin/your-features/${id}`,
} as const

export const YOUR_FEATURE_QUERY_KEYS = {
  all: ['your-features'] as const,
  lists: () => [...YOUR_FEATURE_QUERY_KEYS.all, 'list'] as const,
  list: (params: YourFeatureFilterParams) => [...YOUR_FEATURE_QUERY_KEYS.lists(), params] as const,
  details: () => [...YOUR_FEATURE_QUERY_KEYS.all, 'detail'] as const,
  detail: (id: number) => [...YOUR_FEATURE_QUERY_KEYS.details(), id] as const,
}

export const STATUS_OPTIONS = [
  { value: 'active', label: 'yourFeature.statusOptions.active' },
  { value: 'inactive', label: 'yourFeature.statusOptions.inactive' },
] as const
```

### `services/your-feature.service.ts`
Object with async methods, each taking an optional `signal?: AbortSignal` for cancellation.

```ts
import axiosInstance from '@/core/api/axios.config'

export const yourFeatureService = {
  async getAll(params?: YourFeatureFilterParams, signal?: AbortSignal) {
    const { data } = await axiosInstance.get<YourFeaturesResponse>(
      YOUR_FEATURE_ENDPOINTS.BASE, { params, signal }
    )
    return data
  },
  async getById(id: number, signal?: AbortSignal) {
    const { data } = await axiosInstance.get(YOUR_FEATURE_ENDPOINTS.DETAIL(id), { signal })
    return data
  },
  async update(id: number, payload: YourFeatureUpdateRequest, signal?: AbortSignal) {
    const { data } = await axiosInstance.put(YOUR_FEATURE_ENDPOINTS.UPDATE(id), payload, { signal })
    return data
  },
}
```

### `hooks/` — one file per operation
Thin wrappers around TanStack Query. See `frontend-tanstack-query` skill for full patterns.

### `schemas/your-feature.schema.ts`
Zod schemas used for both route search validation and form validation. Functions that accept `t: TFunction` for translated error messages. See `frontend-tanstack-form` skill.

### `components/index.ts`
Named re-exports only — makes imports clean from route files.

```ts
export { YourFeatureList } from './YourFeatureList'
export { YourFeatureDetail } from './YourFeatureDetail'
export { YourFeatureFilters } from './YourFeatureFilters'
```

### `index.ts` (feature root)
Barrel export of the feature's public API. Route files import from here or from specific sub-paths.

```ts
export * from './components'
export * from './hooks'
export * from './types'
```

## Connecting to Routes

Route files live in `src/routes/_layout/your-section/your-feature/`:
- `index.tsx` — list page (imports `YourFeatureList`, `YourFeatureFilters`, query hook)
- `create.tsx` — create form page
- `$featureId/index.tsx` — detail page (uses loader to prefetch)
- `$featureId/edit.tsx` — edit form page

Routes are thin: they handle URL params/search, call hooks, and render feature components. Business logic stays in the feature folder.

## Form Sections Pattern

For complex forms, split fields into section components under `YourFeatureFormSections/`. Each section receives `form` as a typed prop:

```tsx
interface BasicInfoSectionProps {
  form: YourFeatureFormApi
}

export function BasicInfoSection({ form }: BasicInfoSectionProps) {
  return (
    <FormSectionCard title="Basic Info">
      <form.AppField name="name">
        {(field) => <field.TextField label={t('feature.name')} />}
      </form.AppField>
    </FormSectionCard>
  )
}
```

The `YourFeatureFormApi` type is defined in the schema file:
```ts
export interface YourFeatureFormApi extends AppFormApi<YourFeatureFormData> {}
```
